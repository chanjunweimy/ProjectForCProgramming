# ProjectForCProgramming

This project is meant for us to practice our C and C++ skills. Anyone is welcomed to contribute code and exercises too! Note that these code do not represent official answers to the exercises; they are merely a product of our logical thinking. If you have a better and more elegant solution to the problems, do not hesitate to add your code by opening a pull request! 

The repo is organised *largely* as follows:
* Beginning: Most problems are from [CS1010 Programming Methodology](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs1010/). For people to revise their C/C++ skills and for those who are just starting off.
* Intermediate: Most problems are from CS1020E Data Structures and Algorithms and [CS2010 Data Structures and Algorithms II](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~stevenha/cs2010.html).  
* Advanced: Most problems are from [Competitive Programming 3](http://cpbook.net), some other competitive programming websites or interview questions. Basically the tough questions we find to grill us up to standards.
