### Vim Shortcuts 
Vim is my favourite editor. Here are some keyboard shortcuts I use, and would like to use but occasionally forget about it. I also add in my favourite plugins. If you're still very confused and perplex by this fantastic editor, [Your problem with Vim is that you don't grok vi](https://gist.github.com/nifl/1178878). There are also lots more articles on Vim tricks, like from [zzapper](http://zzapper.co.uk/vimtips.html), [Cats Who Code](http://zzapper.co.uk/vimtips.html) and [Positive Programming](https://takac.github.io/assets/grammar-slide.html). And if you're still wanting more cheatsheets, just [search on Github](https://github.com/search?utf8=âœ“&q=vim+cheatsheets).
